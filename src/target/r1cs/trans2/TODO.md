To do:
* bit-vector lower
* field flatten
* clean visibilities
* better Pf2Bv in SMT BE

Done:
* basic Pf2Bv in SMT BE
* verification FE filtering on ops, sorts
* completeness
* boolean ITE
* encoding polymorphism (attempt 1):
  * encodings and encoding types
  * rule types: rules, variable rules, conversion rules
  * encoding type chooser
* input encoding for booleans
* boolean majority
* fix boolean constant VC

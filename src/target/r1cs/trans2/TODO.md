To do:
* bv lowering
* heterogeneous input encodings (BV ITE)
* field flatten
* clean visibilities
* better Pf2Bv in SMT BE

Done:
* fix variable soundness VC (universal quantifiers)
* FE filters for rule types
* conversion completeness VC
* variable completeness VC
* conversion soundness VC
* Improve FE output for param'd sort patterns
* re-org traits
* basic Pf2Bv in SMT BE
* verification FE filtering on ops, sorts
* completeness
* boolean ITE
* encoding polymorphism (attempt 1):
  * encodings and encoding types
  * rule types: rules, variable rules, conversion rules
  * encoding type chooser
* input encoding for booleans
* boolean majority
* fix boolean constant VC
